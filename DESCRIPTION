Title: Location overlap analysis for enrichment of genomic ranges
Description: Provides functions for testing overlap of sets of genomic regions with public 
	and custom region set (genomic ranges) databases. 
	This make is possible to do automated enrichment analysis for genomic region sets, 
	thus facilitating interpretation of functional genomics and epigenomics data.
