# This function calculates enrichment for two sets of genomic ranges intervals

# There are multiple legitimate ways to construct this kind of a test.
# It seems efficient to do what I'm doing. I take a user-set-centric approach.

# a - [support]. This could be either: the number of user regions that overlap
# at least 1 test region; or, the number of test regions that overlap
# at least 1 user region. These can be different if, for example, there are
# two test regions that overlap one user region; or vice versa. I take the
# number in the user set.
# b - [test set overlaps universe]. this could be either the number in the
# test set that overlaps at least 1 universe region, or the # in the universe
# that overlaps at least 1 test region. Using the user-set-centric approach,
# I take the # in the universe that overlap at least 1 test region.
# c - [non-hits in user set]. For this I take the size of the
# user set - support; this is the rest of the user set that did not have any
# overlaps to the test set.
# d - [size of universe - b -c -a]

# If you took a test-set centric approach, things could be slightly different.
# The user-set approach I take relies on the assumption that the user set
# regions are actually contained in the user universe. what if the user set
# contains 3 regions where the user universe is one large region? this could
# contribute 3 hits to support, but then it should also contribute 3 hits
# to b -- this could lead to errors. so, the universe must be divided on the
# divisions of the user sets at least.

#Unit Set Enrichment
#generic term "unit" refers most likely to genes, for a gene set enrichment
# analysis, but can refer to anything.
#a database set contains:
#1. a universe: the set of all possible units tested for the category of interest.
#2. the unit set: the set of all units that were positive for the test.
#3. name: an identifier that describes what this set was tested for.

# If the universe is not provided, we could consider the set of al
# ensembl genes or something like that (for gene-based)...


#a query set contains the same thing:
# 1. a query unit set: the set of units that have some property in common,
# which we wish to test for association to the database unit sets.
# 2. the tested units that were not positive.

# Both of these sets should first be restricted to the "universe"

#' This function will take the user sets, overlap with the universe,
#' and redefine the user sets as the set of regions in the user
#' universe that overlap at least one region in user sets. this makes
#' for a more appropriate statistical enrichment comparison, as the user
#' sets are actually exactly the same regions found in the universe
#' otherwise, you can get some weird artifacts from the many-to-many
#' relationship between user set regions and universe regions.
